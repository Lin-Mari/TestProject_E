### Vector Shapes
When using the shape tools, they create `vector shapes`. A vector shape is made up of `vector points`, and connected through mathmatical curves or lines called `paths`. Vecor shapes can be scaled [`lossless`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) to any size. What this means is unlike convential [`rater images`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) which pixelate when scaled larger, `vecotor shapes` will always look the same at any scale.
