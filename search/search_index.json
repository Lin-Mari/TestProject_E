When moving or resising the group elements inside of that group will move or resise relative to their position within the group. (example if you have a group with two squares 20px x 20px spaced 20px apart. When resising the group 20px larger the square sise and spacing between the squares will increase as well, maintaining the same aspect ratio.)</p> <p>Frames: A frame is a desegnated visible area. Elements can be put inside a frame which will clip (hide), the elements iside only displaying what is visible withing the frame size. (example. If  a picture of 800x600 is put inside a frame of 400x400, only  the parts of the picture whch is inside the 400x400 grid will be displayed. the rest of the picture will be hidden.)</p> <p>Components: We use components on thing which are repeatable or have certain states to make repeating the same design easy or switching states possible. (example. WHen creating a button for your design we would like to have it change colour. We use a component to create variants of the button which en ables us to create a \"while hovering\" animation to allow the button to change states. Also istead of re-creating or copying the button 5 times we can simply import it from the assets. This allows us to, if we want, change the look of the \"mother\" button which will change all \"child\" buttons as well.)</p> <p>Plugins: Plugins allow us to speed up designs by enabling certain fuctionalities that we might require. Some plugin provides us with free to use pictures or icons so we dont infringe on copyrights, while oters allows more complex interactive map designs to be possible.

You can view all the availible themes on the mkdocs themes page. Some themes are created for different applications or purposes.
